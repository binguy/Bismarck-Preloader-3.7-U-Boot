/* 
 * yiruei note in 20181101
 */
 
This version of SPI code is a new one created by yirueuchen for 97G in 20181101.
This version is based on previous code (which is kept as dw_spi_base_test_original.c) maintained by Carl before 8197G.
This version only supports configuration and R/W SPI DR only since the verification of 97G board must be connected with 98FH ASIC.
Note that 8197G has no DMA so that this verison also has no DMA realted codes.
